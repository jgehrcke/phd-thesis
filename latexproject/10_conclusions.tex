\chapter{Conclusions}


- cooperative binding behavior
- binding in that region might affect R2 binding according to the model
    presented in ...

    no binding specificity (this is something for outlook)


    - Methodological development
        - Binding site prediction
        - Clustering
        - DMD
        - Experimental setup: HPC, ZIH and group-internal
    - Insights for IL-10-GAG system
        - binding site
        - binding behavior (heparin, N sulfate, conformation, important residue)
        - binding implications
