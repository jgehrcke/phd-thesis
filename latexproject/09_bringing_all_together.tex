\chapter{Bringing pieces together: IL-10-GAG interaction insights}

    - Binding region/site
    - Binding features
    - Variation of behavior among GAG types
    - Implications on biology: interference with R2, agglomeration of IL-10
    - Other hypotheses
        - Binding overlaps with R1


\hl{Note (TODO):}
Show picture of R107 specifically marked in the structure, together with
crystal sulfates, discuss possible binding poses involving these crystal
sulfates. Nee, mach das sp√§ter, bei bringing it all together.

The two binding poses shown in the DMD-IL-10 chapter yeah!


\hl{Note (TODO):}
Discuss models explaining impact of IL-10-GAG interaction on IL-10 biology.

Show image that schematically shows how IL-10 might be caugt by cell-surface-attached GAGs.
