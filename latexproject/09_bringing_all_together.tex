\chapter{Bringing it all together: IL-10-GAG interaction insights}
\lipsum[1-10]


\hl{Note (TODO):}
Show picture of R107 specifically marked in the structure, together with
crystal sulfates, discuss possible binding poses involving these crystal
sulfates. Nee, mach das sp√§ter, bei bringing it all together.

\hl{Note (TODO):}
Discuss models explaining impact of IL-10-GAG interaction on IL-10 biology.

Show image that schematically shows how IL-10 might be caugt by cell-surface-attached GAGs.
