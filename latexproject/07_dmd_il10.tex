\chapter{DMD applied to the IL-10-GAG system}

In order to exploit the predictive power of DMD for the IL-10-GAG system, we
have performed several DMD studies differing in DMD parameterization and
molecular system setup. Conducting these studies required an increment of the
computational resources available to us by orders of magnitudes. In the course
of performing these studies we continuously refined our software architecture
for controlling the corresponding high performance computing resources and
enriched our DMD data analysis framework. This chapter seeks to present
\textit{i)} the computational challenges, \textit{ii)} the methodological
details, and \textit{iii)} the major outcomes of this endeavor.


\section{Methods}

\subsection{DMD study design}

As a reminder, the term DMD study covers many DMD run repetitions followed by
data analysis. Hence, within a single DMD study the \textit{constants} are ---
among others --- the chemical configuration of the ligand molecule and the
geometrical DMD parametrization, i.e.\ the protein core atom and the focus
point. Clearly, for a systematic investigation of the IL-10-GAG system via DMD
we need to \textit{vary} exactly those. That is, that investigation requires the
conduction of \textit{many} DMD studies. By the time of designing the first
IL-10-GAG DMD studies, the conduction and analysis of a single study consumed
about two weeks, given the fact that no technical issues occurred. Hence, time
and computational resources clearly limited the scope of this endeavor. In turn,
were required to get as much conclusive output of as few DMD studies as
possible.

\subsubsection{Factors to investigate}

This obviously interesting variables among the different DMD studies in case of
the IL-10-GAG system are:

\begin{itemize}
\item The geometrical DMD parameterization. In \cref{chapter:bspred}, we have
derived a region of interest for our DMD studies. In order to further narrow
down However, that region is As of the uncertainty in the IL-10-GAG binding
region. We
\item
\item
\end{itemize}

We decided to take an iterative approach. In a first round of DMD studies, we
aimed to gather experience and tried to estimate how the IL-10-GAG system
responds to various kinds of condition changes. Also, since the technical
conditions were unstable, we used this first round of studies for detecting
and resolving technical issues. In this first round of studies, we varied
the geometrical DMD parameterization


In a second round of studies,

\subsection{Computational framework}

\subsubsection{High performance computing resources}


 On state-of-the-art hardware, one
DMD study consumes about 10 years of CPU time. It can be conducted within two
weeks using a large resource pool in the supercomputing center of the TU Dresden (ZIH).
Independently, we have started establishing a group-internal compute cluster making
use of specialized GPU hardware. Using this, one DMD study can also be performed
in about two weeks. Recently, the ZIH has introduced GPU hardware. We have been
part of the testing period and started using their GPU resources for DMD production
runs.

For the purpose of being able to apply DMD on a scale as required by this study,
we have established a

            - Establishment of GPU infrastructure
                - Software: compilation of Amber 12 against ...
                - built up group-internal GPU cluster:
                    4 machines, this hardware, PBS schedular with Python wrapper
                - ZIH resources

\subsubsection{Software architecture}

        - Architecture:
            shell scripts, file system for study organization
            Python/numpy/scipy/matplotlib for analysis
            code on bitbucket



\section{Results and discussion}

\subsection{1st round of DMD studies}



So far, about 10 independent DMD studies involving IL-10 and different GAGs have
been performed. An important intermediate result of the corresponding data analysis
is that one amino acid residue, R107 (in the hIL-10 sequence, conserved in mouse), significantly
stands out compared to all other residues and supposedly plays a particularly
important role in IL-10-GAG recognition. This conclusion is based on different types
of data, including time-averaged hydrogen bonding analysis and single-residue energy
decomposition applied to MD data collected on the microsecond time scale

Observations in first round of studies:

\begin{itemize}

\item slight change in DMD geometry parameterization does not change outcome (different starting conditions, very similar outcome -- show figure on page 25 of 131030_3rd_tac )
\item Heparin length change yields same outcome
\item Complete inclusion of IL-10's N terminus does not qualitatively change hbond/SRED data (130530 groupmeeting pdf)
\item Again: DMD reproducible results!
\item MM-GBSA SRED yields consistent outcome with hydrogen bonding analysis,
whereas hbond analysis is much simpler

\end{itemize}
