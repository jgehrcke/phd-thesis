\chapter{DMD applied to the IL-10-GAG system}

\section{Methods}

\subsection{DMD study design}


    - Study design / overview
        - iterative approach
            1st round, collect experience
            2nd round, start with most probable region
        - GAG ligand selection

First iteration


N= 200 or 300


Second iteration


\subsubsection{DMD data analysis}

 list all analysis steps performed, i.e. conceptually clarifly the entire
 work flow here

 trajectories -> analysis -> merging -> clustering -> cluster stats, etc


\subsection{Computational framework}

\subsubsection{High performance computing resources}


        - Computing resources
            - Establishment of GPU infrastructure
                - Software: compilation of Amber 12 against ...
                - built up group-internal GPU cluster:
                    4 machines, this hardware, PBS schedular with Python wrapper
                - ZIH resources

\subsubsection{Software architecture}

        - Architecture:
            shell scripts, file system for study organization
            Python/numpy/scipy/matplotlib for analysis
            code on bitbucket



\section{Results and discussion}

        - 1st round
        - 2nd round
