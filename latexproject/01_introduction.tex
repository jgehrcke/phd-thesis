Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) play a critical role in many biological processes.
Their multifarious biological activity arises from their ability to interact
with and regulate a large number of proteins \cite{handel:2005}. We are
interested in GAG interaction with the cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10, reviewed
in \cite{moore:2001}), which is generally considered to exert an
immunosuppressive function. From \textit{in vitro} experiments, IL-10 is known
to bind GAGs and there is evidence that GAGs may modulate its biological
function \cite{salek_ardakani:2000}. So far however, no structural detail about
IL-10-GAG interaction is known. The aim of this project is to unravel atomic
details of IL-10-GAG interaction with theoretical and computational means. If
required, methodological approaches are to be developed. Integration of
\textit{in silico}-based predictions with experimental results from
collaborators will hopefully provide insights into the mechanisms determining
IL-10-GAG interaction. Methodology developed during this project is applicable
to protein-GAG systems in general, rendering it valuable for a large field of
research.
