  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:Is it possible to identify what the best solution of a docking program is? The usual answer to this question is the highest score solution, but interactions between proteins are dynamic processes, and many times the interaction regions are wide enough to permit protein-protein interactions with different orientations and/or interaction energies. In some cases, as in a multimeric protein complex, several interaction regions are possible among the monomers. These dynamic processes involve interactions with surface displacements between the proteins to finally achieve the functional configuration of the protein complex. Consequently, there is not a static and single solution for the interaction between proteins, but there are several important configurations that also have to be analyzed.RESULTS:To extract those representative solutions from the docking output datafile, we have developed an unsupervised and automatic clustering application, named DockAnalyse. This application is based on the already existing DBscan clustering method, which searches for continuities among the clusters generated by the docking output data representation. The DBscan clustering method is very robust and, moreover, solves some of the inconsistency problems of the classical clustering methods like, for example, the treatment of outliers and the dependence of the previously defined number of clusters.CONCLUSIONS:DockAnalyse makes the interpretation of the docking solutions through graphical and visual representations easier by guiding the user to find the representative solutions. We have applied our new approach to analyze several protein interactions and model the dynamic protein interaction behavior of a protein complex. DockAnalyse might also be used to describe interaction regions between proteins and, therefore, guide future flexible dockings. The application (implemented in the R package) is accessible.},

  Abstract                 = {Treating flexibility in molecular docking is a major challenge in cell biology research. Here we describe the background and the principles of existing flexible protein-protein docking methods, focusing on the algorithms and their rational. We describe how protein flexibility is treated in different stages of the docking process: in the preprocessing stage, rigid and flexible parts are identified and their possible conformations are modeled. This preprocessing provides information for the subsequent docking and refinement stages. In the docking stage, an ensemble of pre-generated conformations or the identified rigid domains may be docked separately. In the refinement stage, small-scale movements of the backbone and side-chains are modeled and the binding orientation is improved by rigid-body adjustments. For clarity of presentation, we divide the different methods into categories. This should allow the reader to focus on the most suitable method for a particular docking problem.},

A broad range of thermodynamic signatures is found in which water (rather than cavity or ligand) enthalpic or entropic contributions appear to drive cavity−ligand binding or rejection. The unprecedented, nanoscale picture of hydration thermodynamics can help the interpretation and design of protein−ligand binding experiments. Our study opens appealing perspectives to tackle the challenge of solvent entropy estimation in complex systems and for improving molecular simulation models.},

Here, we evaluated the search capabilities of three widely used {programsGRID}, {DOCK}, and {AutoDockfor} heparin binding sites. Because of the weak surface complementarity and the high charge density of the sulfated sugar chain, the docking of heparin to its protein partners presents a challenging task for computational docking. Our protocols were tested on antithrombin and acidic and basic fibroblast growth factor, the only three proteins for which structures of their complexes with heparin are available. With all three programs, the heparin binding site for these test cases was determined correctly. We then used these protocols to predict the heparin binding site on Interleukin-8, a chemokine with a central role in the human immune response. The results indicate that His18, Lys20, Arg60, Lys64, and Arg68 in interleukin-8 bind to heparin.},

C4-S forms multiple contacts with amino acid residues on the backside of the catK molecule that help to facilitate complex formation. As cathepsin L does not exhibit a significant collagenase activity in the presence or in the absence of C4-S, we substituted the C4-S interacting residues in catK with those of cathepsin L. Variants revealed altered collagenolytic activities with the largest inhibitory effect shown by the hexavariant M5. None of the variants showed a reduction in their gelatinolytic and peptidolytic activities when compared with wild-type catK, indicating no structural alteration within their active sites. However, the crystal structure of the M5 variant in the presence of oligomeric C4-S revealed a different binding of chondroitin 4-sulfate. C4-S is not continuously ordered as it is in the wild-type catK·C4-S complex. The orientation and the direction of the hexasaccharide on the catK surface have changed, so that the hexasaccharide is positioned between two symmetry-related molecules. Only one M5 variant molecule of the dimer that is present in the asymmetric unit interacts with C4-S. These substitutions have changed the mode of catK binding to C4-S and, as a result, have likely affected the collagenolytic potential of the variant. The data presented here support our hypothesis that distinct catK/C4-S interactions are necessary for the collagenolytic activity of the enzyme.},

Our solvated docking protocol is based on the concept of the first encounter complex in which a water layer is present in-between the molecules. It mimics the pathway from this initial complex towards the final assembly in which most waters have been expelled from the interface. Docking is performed from solvated biomolecules and waters are removed in a biased Monte Carlo procedure based on water-mediated contact propensities obtained from an analysis of high-resolution crystal structures. {RESULTS:} We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach for protein-protein complexes representing both "wet" and "dry" interfaces. Solvated docking leads to improvements both in quality and scoring. Water molecules are recovered that closely match the ones in the crystal structures.},

The heparin structure may be approximated as a helical polymer with a disaccharide rotation of 174 degrees and a translation of 8.6 angstroms along the helix axis. Both molecules bound similarly to a region of the {bFGF} surface containing residues asparagine-28, arginine-121, lysine-126, and glutamine-135, the hexasaccharide also interacted with an additional binding site formed by lysine-27, asparagine-102, and lysine-136. No significant conformational change in {bFGF} occurred upon heparin oligosaccharide binding, which suggests that heparin primarily serves to juxtapose components of the {FGF} signal transduction pathway.},

  Abstract                 = {Glycosaminoglycans ({GAGs)} are important complex carbohydrates that participate in many biological processes through the regulation of their various protein partners. Biochemical, structural biology and molecular modelling approaches have assisted in understanding the molecular basis of such interactions, creating an opportunity to capitalize on the large structural diversity of {GAGs} in the discovery of new drugs. The complexity of {GAG-protein} interactions is in part due to the conformational flexibility and underlying sulphation patterns of {GAGs}, the role of metal ions and the effect of {pH} on the affinity of binding. Current understanding of the structure of {GAGs} and their interactions with proteins is here reviewed: the basic structures and functions of {GAGs} and their proteoglycans, their clinical significance, the three-dimensional features of {GAGs}, their interactions with proteins and the molecular modelling of heparin binding sites and {GAG-protein} interactions. This review focuses on some key aspects of {GAG} structure-function relationships using classical examples that illustrate the specificity of {GAG-protein} interactions, such as growth factors, anti-thrombin, cytokines and cell adhesion molecules. New approaches to the development of {GAG} mimetics as possible new glycotherapeutics are also briefly covered.},

  Abstract                 = {Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are complex highly charged linear polysaccharides that have a variety of roles in biological processes. We report the first use of molecular dynamics (MD) free energy calculations using the MM/PBSA method to investigate the binding of GAGs to protein molecules, namely the platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1) and annexin A2. Calculations of the free energy of the binding of heparin fragments of different sizes reveal the existence of a region of low GAG-binding affinity in domains 5–6 of PECAM-1 and a region of high affinity in domains 2–3, consistent with experimental data and ligand–protein docking studies. A conformational hinge movement between domains 2 and 3 was observed, which allows the binding of heparin fragments of increasing size (pentasaccharides to octasaccharides) with an increasingly higher binding affinity. Similar simulations of the binding of a heparin fragment to annexin A2 reveal the optimization of electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions with the protein and protein-bound calcium ions. In general, these free energy calculations reveal that the binding of heparin to protein surfaces is dominated by strong electrostatic interactions for longer fragments, with equally important contributions from van der Waals interactions and vibrational entropy changes, against a large unfavorable desolvation penalty due to the high charge density of these molecules.},

  Abstract                 = {Proteins are dynamic molecules and often undergo conformational change upon ligand binding. It is widely accepted that flexible loop regions have a critical functional role in enzymes. Lack of consideration of binding site flexibility has led to failures in predicting protein functions and in successfully docking ligands with protein receptors. Here we address the question: which sequence and structural features distinguish the structurally flexible and rigid binding sites? We analyze high-resolution crystal structures of ligand bound (holo) and free (apo) forms of 41 proteins where no conformational change takes place upon ligand binding, 35 examples with moderate conformational change, and 22 cases where a large conformational change has been observed. We find that the number of residue-residue contacts observed per-residue (contact density) does not distinguish flexible and rigid binding sites, suggesting a role for specific interactions and amino acids in modulating the conformational changes. Examination of hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions reveals that cases that do not undergo conformational change have high polar interactions constituting the binding pockets. Intriguingly, the large, aromatic amino acid tryptophan has a high propensity to occur at the binding sites of examples where a large conformational change has been noted. Further, in large conformational change examples, hydrophobic-hydrophobic, aromatic-aromatic, and hydrophobic-polar residue pair interactions are dominant. Further analysis of the Ramachandran dihedral angles (phi, psi) reveals that the residues adopting disallowed conformations are found in both rigid and flexible cases. More importantly, the binding site residues adopting disallowed conformations clustered narrowly into two specific regions of the L-Ala Ramachandran map. Examination of the dihedral angles changes upon ligand binding shows that the magnitude of phi, psi changes are in general minimal, although some large changes particularly between right-handed alpha-helical and extended conformations are seen. Our work further provides an account of conformational changes in the dihedral angles space. The findings reported here are expected to assist in providing a framework for predicting protein-ligand complexes and for template-based prediction of protein function.},

We have analysed the structures of 60 different enzymes to see if conformational changes are observed between the apo form, and the substrate (or substrate analog) bound form. In each enzyme the residues responsible for catalysis and substrate binding are known and are examined to see how the active site area is affected by conformational changes. Surprisingly, we find that induced fit motions in most enzymes is very small (usually 1 A {RMSD} between the apo and substrate-bound forms across the whole protein). We also find that there is a significant difference between the motions undergone by the binding residues and those undergone by the catalytic residues. The binding residues tend to exhibit larger backbone motions, but both binding and catalytic residues show the same, considerable, amount of side-chain flexibility. Knowing the extent of induced fit in enzymes is important for our understanding of the principles of enzyme catalysis and also for improving ligand docking and structural template searching.},

  Abstract                 = {Ab initio self-consistent field ({SCF)} Hartree-Fock calculations of sulfates {R\&bond;O\&bond;SO3(-1)} (R = Me, Et, i-Pr) and sulfamates {R\&bond;NHSO3(-1)} (R = H, Me, Et, i-Pr) were performed at the 4-{31G(*S*N)} //3-{21G(*S*N)} basis set levels, where asterisks indicate d functions on sulfur and nitrogen atoms. These standard levels were determined by comparing calculation results with several basis sets up to {MP2/6-31G*//6-31G*.} Several conformations per compound were studied to obtain molecular geometries, rotational barriers, and potential derived point charges. In methyl sulfate, the rotational barrier around the {C\&bond;O} bond is 1.6 kcal/mol at the {MP2} level and 1.4 kcal/mol at the standard level. Its ground state has one of three {HCOS} torsion angles trans and one of three {COSO} torsion angles trans. Rotation over 60° around the single {O\&bond;S} bond in the sulfate group costs 2.5 kcal/mol at the {MP2} and 2.1 kcal/mol at the standard level. For ethyl sulfate, the calculated rotational barrier in going from the ground state, which has its {CCOS} torsion angle trans, to the syn-periplanar conformation ({CCOS} torsion angle cis) is 4.8 kcal/mol. However, a much lower barrier of 0.7 kcal/mol leads to a secondary gauchelike conformation about 0.4 kcal/mol above the ground state, with the {CCOS} torsion angle at 87.6°. Again, one of the {COSO} torsion angles is trans in the ground state, and the rotational barrier for a 60° rotation of the sulfate group amounts to 1.8 kcal/mol. For methyl sulfamate, the rotational barriers are 2.5 kcal/mol around the {C\&bond;N} bond and 3.3 kcal/mol around the {N\&bond;S} bond. This is noteworthy because sulfamate itself has a calculated rotational barrier around the {N\&bond;S} bond of only 1.7 kcal/mol. These and other data were used to parameterize the well-known empirical force fields {AMBER} and {CHARMm.} When the new fields were tested by means of vibrational frequency calculations at the 6-{31G*//6-31G*} level for methyl sulfate, sulfamate, and methyl sulfamate ground states, the frequencies compared favorably with the {AMBER} and {CHARMm} calculated frequencies. The transferability of the force parameters to beta-D-glucose-6-sulfate and isopropyl sulfate appears to be better than to isopropyl sulfamate. © 1995 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

The {ECM} has many effects beyond providing structural support. {ECM} proteins typically include multiple, independently folded domains whose sequences and arrangement are highly conserved. Some of these domains bind adhesion receptors such as integrins that mediate cell-matrix adhesion and also transduce signals into cells. However, {ECM} proteins also bind soluble growth factors and regulate their distribution, activation, and presentation to cells. As organized, solid-phase ligands, {ECM} proteins can integrate complex, multivalent signals to cells in a spatially patterned and regulated fashion. These properties need to be incorporated into considerations of the functions of the {ECM.}},

To determine the quality of current binding free energy estimation programs, we examined {FlexX}, X-Score, {AutoDock}, and {BLEEP} for their performance in binding free energy prediction in various situations including cocrystallized complex structures, cross docking of ligands to their non-cocrystallized receptors, docking of thermally unfolded receptor decoys to their ligands, and complex structures with "randomized" ligand decoys. In no case was there a satisfactory correlation between the experimental and estimated binding free energies over all the datasets tested. Meanwhile, a strong correlation between ligand molecular weight-binding affinity correlation and experimental predicted binding affinity correlation was found. Sometimes the programs also correctly ranked ligands' binding affinities even though native interactions between the ligands and their receptors were essentially lost because of receptor deformation or ligand randomization, and the programs could not decisively discriminate randomized ligand decoys from their native ligands; this suggested that the tested programs miss important components for the accurate capture of specific ligand binding interactions.},

  Abstract                 = {A new derivation of the {GLYCAM06} force field, which removes its previous specificity for carbohydrates, and its dependency on the {AMBER} force field and parameters, is presented. All pertinent force field terms have been explicitly specified and so no default or generic parameters are employed. The new {GLYCAM} is no longer limited to any particular class of biomolecules, but is extendible to all molecular classes in the spirit of a small-molecule force field. The torsion terms in the present work were all derived from quantum mechanical data from a collection of minimal molecular fragments and related small molecules. For carbohydrates, there is now a single parameter set applicable to both α- and β-anomers and to all monosaccharide ring sizes and conformations. We demonstrate that deriving dihedral parameters by fitting to {QM} data for internal rotational energy curves for representative small molecules generally leads to correct rotamer populations in molecular dynamics simulations, and that this approach removes the need for phase corrections in the dihedral terms. However, we note that there are cases where this approach is inadequate. Reported here are the basic components of the new force field as well as an illustration of its extension to carbohydrates. In addition to reproducing the gas-phase properties of an array of small test molecules, condensed-phase simulations employing {GLYCAM06} are shown to reproduce rotamer populations for key small molecules and representative biopolymer building blocks in explicit water, as well as crystalline lattice properties, such as unit cell dimensions, and vibrational frequencies. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  Abstract                 = {Structure-based design has emerged as a new tool in medicinal chemistry. A prerequisite for this new approach is an understanding of the principles of molecular recognition in protein-ligand complexes. If the three-dimensional structure of a given protein is known, this information can be directly exploited for the retrieval and design of new ligands. Structure-based ligand design is an iterative approach. First of all, it requires the crystal structure or a model derived from the crystal structure of a closely related homolog of the target protein, preferentially complexed with a ligand. This complex unravels the binding mode and conformation of a ligand under investigation and indicates the essential aspects determining its binding affinity. It is then used to generate new ideas about ways of improving an existing ligand or of developing new alternative bonding skeletons. Computational methods supplemented by molecular graphics are applied to assist this step of hypothesis generation. The features of the protein binding pocket can be translated into queries used for virtual computer screening of large compound libraries or to design novel ligands de novo. These initial proposals must be confirmed experimentally. Subsequently they are optimized toward higher affinity and better selectivity. The latter aspect is of utmost importance in defining and controlling the pharmacological profile of a ligand. A prerequisite to tailoring selectivity by rational design is a detailed understanding of molecular parameters determining selectivity. Taking examples from current drug development programs ({HIV} proteinase, t-{RNA} transglycosylase, thymidylate synthase, thrombin and, related serine proteinases), we describe recent advances in lead discovery via computer screening, iterative design, and understanding of selectivity discrimination.},

One target involved protein-{RNA} interactions not previously considered in {CAPRI}, several others were hetero-oligomers, or featured multiple interfaces between the same protein pair. For most targets, predictions started from the experimentally determined structures of the free (unbound) components, or from models built from known structures of related or similar proteins. To succeed they therefore needed to account for conformational changes and model inaccuracies. In total, 64 groups and 12 web-servers submitted docking predictions of which 4420 were evaluated. Overall our assessment reveals that 67\% of the groups, more than ever before, produced acceptable models or better for at least one target, with many groups submitting multiple high- and medium-accuracy models for two to six targets. Forty-one groups including four web-servers participated in the scoring experiment with 1296 evaluated models. Scoring predictions also show signs of progress evidenced from the large proportion of correct models submitted. But singling out the best models remains a challenge, which also adversely affects the ability to correctly rank docking models. With the increased interest in translating abstract protein interaction networks into realistic models of protein assemblies, the growing {CAPRI} community is actively developing more efficient and reliable docking and scoring methods for everyone to use. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  Abstract                 = {In addition to its typical role as a scaffold, molecular filter, and cell modulator, the pericellular matrix can bind bioactive molecules and serve as a repository, while regulating their activation, synthesis, and degradation. This review focuses on interactions between bioactives, specifically growth factors and cytokines, with various components of the pericellular matrix. For example, biglycan and betaglycan, proteoglycans of the pericellular matrix, and decorin, a proteoglycan of the interstitial extracellular matrix, bind and regulate the activity and availability of transforming growth factor-beta. From evidence presented in this paper, it is obvious that the presence of growth factors in the pericellular matrix is integral to the spatiotemporal coordination of cellular activities to ensure proper tissue/organ formation during wound healing. It is believed by many researchers that the delivery of the right growth factors at the right time is instrumental to the orchestration of tissue regeneration. Thus, the interplay between the pericellular environment and bioactive molecules provides an underutilized knowledge base in the design and creation of tissue engineered constructs.},

  Abstract                 = {Protein–protein binding is one of the critical events in biology, and knowledge of proteic complexes three-dimensional structures is of fundamental importance for the biochemical study of pharmacologic compounds. In the past two decades there was an emergence of a large variety of algorithms designed to predict the structures of protein–protein complexes—a procedure named docking. Computational methods, if accurate and reliable, could play an important role, both to infer functional properties and to guide new experiments. Despite the outstanding progress of the methodologies developed in this area, a few problems still prevent protein–protein docking to be a widespread practice in the structural study of proteins. In this review we focus our attention on the principles that govern docking, namely the algorithms used for searching and scoring, which are usually referred as the docking problem. We also focus our attention on the use of a flexible description of the proteins under study and the use of biological information as the localization of the hot spots, the important residues for protein–protein binding. The most common docking softwares are described too. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Comput Chem, 2010},

  Abstract                 = {Sulfated polysaccharides are capable of binding with proteins at several levels of specificity. As highly acidic macromolecules, they can bind non-specifically to any basic patch on a protein surface at low ionic strength, and such interactions are not likely to be physiologically significant. On the other hand, several systems have been identified in which very specific substructures of sulfated polysaccharides confer high affinity for particular proteins; the best-known example of this is the pentasaccharide in heparin with high affinity for antithrombin, but other examples may be taken from the study of marine invertebrates: the importance of the fine structure of dermatan sulfate ({DS)} to its interaction with heparin cofactor {II} ({HCII)}, and the involvement of sea urchin egg-jelly fucans in species specific fertilization. A third, intermediate, kind of specific interaction is described for the cell-surface glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate ({HS)}, in which patterns of sulfate substitution can show differential affinities for cytokines, growth factors, and morphogens at cell surfaces and in the intracellular matrix. This complex interplay of proteins and glycans is capable of influencing the diffusion of such proteins through tissue, as well as modulating cellular responses to them.},

  Abstract                 = {The glycosaminoglycans heparin and heparan sulfate contain similar structural units in varying proportions providing considerable diversity in sequence and biological function. Both compounds are alternating copolymers of glucosamine with both iduronate- and glucuronate-containing sequences bearing N-sulfate, N-acetyl, and O-sulfate substitution. Protein recognition of these structurally-diverse compounds depends upon substitution pattern, overall molecular shape, and on internal mobility. In this review particular attention is paid to the dynamic aspects of heparin/heparan sulfate conformation. The iduronate residue possesses an unusually flexible pyranose ring conformation. This extra source of internal mobility creates special problems in rationalization of experimental data for these compounds. We present herein the solution-state NMR parameters, fiber diffraction data, crystallographic data, and molecular modeling methods employed in the investigation of heparin and heparan sulfate. Heparin is a useful model compound for the sulfated, protein-binding regions of heparan sulfate. The literature contains a number of solution and solid-state studies of heparin oligo- and polysaccharides for both isolated heparin species and those bound to protein receptors. These studies indicate a diversity of iduronate ring conformations, but a limited range of glycosidic linkage geometries in the repeating disaccharides. In this sense, heparin exhibits a well-defined overall shape within which iduronate ring forms can freely interconvert. Recent work suggests that computational modeling could potentially identify heparin binding sites on protein surfaces.},

However, this methodology is subjected to the experimental uncertainties of the J-coupling measurements, the force field deviations and the goodness of the least-squares fit. In the present work, we have used time-averaged distance restrained molecular dynamics (tar-MD) to largely reduce these errors, which enables accurate quantification of the population of conformers, or puckers, of the L-IdoA2S residue, in a set of eight heparin-like trisaccharides following the general sequence d-glucosamine (GlcN)-IdoA-GlcN, directly from the time evolution of the puckering coordinates θ and ϕ. Thus, by carrying out tar-MD simulations in explicit water, with the exclusive nuclear overhauser enhancement (NOE)-derived distance H2–H5 of the L-IdoA2S 2SO conformer as the unique imposed constraint, we have been able to accurately and easily determine the different extents to which the iduronate ring populates the polar (1C4 chair) and equatorial (2SO skew-boat) areas of the puckering sphere depending on the sulfation pattern of the flanking GlcN residues, under low temperature conditions (278 K). The results indicate that 6-O-sulfation at the reducing-end GlcN residue facilitates the 1C4 to 2SO transitions of the iduronate ring by augmenting the flexibility of the C2–C3 torsion, driving the conformational equilibrium toward a majority of equatorial conformers.},

Therefore, the design of {GAG} derivatives for the development of innovative materials with bio-like properties in terms of their interaction with regulatory proteins is of great interest for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Previous work on the chemokine interleukin-8 ({IL-8)} has focused on its interaction with heparin and heparan sulfate, which regulate chemokine function. However, the extracellular matrix contains other {GAGs}, such as hyaluronic acid ({HA)}, dermatan sulfate ({DS)} and chondroitin sulfate ({CS)}, which have so far not been characterized in terms of their distinct molecular recognition properties towards {IL-8} in relation to their length and sulfation patterns. {NMR} and molecular modeling have been in great part the methods of choice to study the structural and recognition properties of {GAGs} and their protein complexes. However, separately these methods have challenges to cope with the high degree of similarity and flexibility that {GAGs} exhibit. In this work, we combine fluorescence spectroscopy, {NMR} experiments, docking and molecular dynamics simulations to study the configurational and recognition properties of {IL-8} towards a series of {HA} and {CS} derivatives and {DS.} We analyze the effects of {GAG} length and sulfation patterns in binding strength and specificity, and the influence of {GAG} binding on {IL-8} dimer formation. Our results highlight the importance of combining experimental and theoretical approaches to obtain a better understanding of the molecular recognition properties of {GAG-protein} systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Docking is one of the most commonly used techniques in drug design. It is used for both identifying correct poses of a ligand in the binding site of a protein as well as for the estimation of the strength of protein–ligand interaction. Because millions of compounds must be screened, before a suitable target for biological testing can be identified, all calculations should be done in a reasonable time frame. Thus, all programs currently in use exploit empirically based algorithms, avoiding systematic search of the conformational space. Similarly, the scoring is done using simple equations, which makes it possible to speed up the entire process. Therefore, docking results have to be verified by subsequent in vitro studies. The purpose of our work was to evaluate seven popular docking programs (Surflex, {LigandFit}, Glide, {GOLD}, {FlexX}, {eHiTS}, and {AutoDock)} on the extensive dataset composed of 1300 protein–ligands complexes from {PDBbind} 2007 database, where experimentally measured binding affinity values were also available. We compared independently the ability of proper posing [according to Root mean square deviation (or Root mean square distance) of predicted conformations versus the corresponding native one] and scoring (by calculating the correlation between docking score and ligand binding strength). To our knowledge, it is the first large-scale docking evaluation that covers both aspects of docking programs, that is, predicting ligand conformation and calculating the strength of its binding. More than 1000 protein–ligand pairs cover a wide range of different protein families and inhibitor classes. Our results clearly showed that the ligand binding conformation could be identified in most cases by using the existing software, yet we still observed the lack of universal scoring function for all types of molecules and protein families. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  Abstract                 = {This article gives an overview of recent progress in protein-protein docking and it identifies several directions for future research. Recent results from the {CAPRI} blind docking experiments show that docking algorithms are steadily improving in both reliability and accuracy. Current docking algorithms employ a range of efficient search and scoring strategies, including e.g. fast Fourier transform correlations, geometric hashing, and Monte Carlo techniques. These approaches can often produce a relatively small list of up to a few thousand orientations, amongst which a near-native binding mode is often observed. However, despite the use of improved scoring functions which typically include models of desolvation, hydrophobicity, and electrostatics, current algorithms still have difficulty in identifying the correct solution from the list of false positives, or decoys. Nonetheless, significant progress is being made through better use of bioinformatics, biochemical, and biophysical information such as e.g. sequence conservation analysis, protein interaction databases, alanine scanning, and {NMR} residual dipolar coupling restraints to help identify key binding residues. Promising new approaches to incorporate models of protein flexibility during docking are being developed, including the use of molecular dynamics snapshots, rotameric and off-rotamer searches, internal coordinate mechanics, and principal component analysis based techniques. Some investigators now use explicit solvent models in their docking protocols. Many of these approaches can be computationally intensive, although new silicon chip technologies such as programmable graphics processor units are beginning to offer competitive alternatives to conventional high performance computer systems. As cryo-{EM} techniques improve apace, docking {NMR} and X-ray protein structures into low resolution {EM} density maps is helping to bridge the resolution gap between these complementary techniques. The use of symmetry and fragment assembly constraints are also helping to make possible docking-based predictions of large multimeric protein complexes. In the near future, the closer integration of docking algorithms with protein interface prediction software, structural databases, and sequence analysis techniques should help produce better predictions of protein interaction networks and more accurate structural models of the fundamental molecular interactions within the cell.}

Comprehensive docking simulations have been performed on a large set of ligandprotein complexes whose crystal structures contain water molecules in their binding sites. Only those water molecules found in the immediate vicinity of both the ligand and the protein were considered. We have investigated whether prior optimization of the orientation of water molecules in either the presence or absence of the bound ligand has any effect on the accuracy of docking predictions. We have observed a statistically significant overall increase in accuracy when water molecules are included during docking simulations and have found this to be independent of the method of optimization of the orientation of water molecules. These results confirm the importance of including water molecules whenever possible in a ligandprotein docking simulation. Our findings also reveal that prior optimization of the orientation of water molecules, in the absence of any bound ligand, does not have a detrimental effect on the improved accuracy of ligandprotein docking. This is important, given the use of docking simulations to predict the binding modes of new ligands or drug molecules.},

  Abstract                 = {Glycosaminoglycans (GAG) are a group of negatively charged molecules that have been shown to bind and directly regulate the bioactivity of growth factors and cytokines such as basic fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factor-beta, IL-7, and interferon-gamma. The ability of GAG to interact with human IL-10 (hIL-10) and the effect of these interactions on its biologic activity were analyzed. It was demonstrated by affinity chromatography that hIL-10 binds strongly to heparin-agarose at physiological pH. Biosensor-based binding kinetic analysis indicated an equilibrium dissociation constant, K(d), of 54 nmol/L for this interaction. Human IL-10 stimulated CD16 and CD64 expression on the monocyte/macrophage population within peripheral blood mononuclear cells, with optimal concentrations between 1 and 10 ng/mL. Soluble heparin, heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, and dermatan sulfate were shown to inhibit the hIL-10-induced expression of CD16 and CD64 in a concentration-dependent manner. Heparin and heparan sulfate were most effective with IC(50) values of 100 to 500 microg/mL. Considerably higher concentrations of dermatan sulfate and chondroitin 4-sulfate were required with an IC(50) of 2,000 to 5,000 microg/mL, whereas chondroitin 6-sulfate was essentially inactive. The antagonistic effect of heparin on hIL-10 activity was shown to be dependent on N-sulfation, inasmuch as de-N-sulfated heparin had little or no inhibitory effect on the IL-10- induced expression of CD16, whereas the effect of de-O-sulfated heparin was comparable to that of unmodified heparin. Furthermore, the inhibition of cell-bound proteoglycan sulfation reduced the hIL-10-mediated expression of CD16 molecules on monocytes/macrophages. Taken together, these findings support the hypothesis that soluble and cell-surface GAG and, in particular, their sulfate groups are important in binding and modulation of hIL-10 activity.

  Abstract                 = {Glycosaminoglycans ({GAGs)} are anionic polysaccharides, which participate in key processes in the extracellular matrix by interactions with protein targets. Due to their charged nature, accurate consideration of electrostatic and water-mediated interactions is indispensable for understanding {GAGs} binding properties. However, solvent is often overlooked in molecular recognition studies. Here we analyze the abundance of solvent in {GAG-protein} interfaces and investigate the challenges of adding explicit solvent in {GAG-protein} docking experiments. We observe {PDB} {GAG-protein} interfaces being significantly more hydrated than protein-protein interfaces. Furthermore, by applying molecular dynamics approaches we estimate that about half of {GAG-protein} interactions are water-mediated. With a dataset of eleven {GAG-protein} complexes we analyze how solvent inclusion affects Autodock 3, {eHiTs}, {MOE} and {FlexX} docking. We develop an approach to de novo place explicit solvent into the binding site prior to docking, which uses the {GRID} program to predict positions of waters and to locate possible areas of solvent displacement upon ligand binding. To investigate how solvent placement affects docking performance, we compare these results with those obtained by taking into account information about the solvent position in the crystal structure. In general, we observe that inclusion of solvent improves the results obtained with these methods. Our data show that Autodock 3 performs best, though it experiences difficulties to quantitatively reproduce experimental data on specificity of heparin/heparan sulfate disaccharides binding to {IL-8.} Our work highlights the current challenges of introducing solvent in protein-{GAGs} recognition studies, which is crucial for exploiting the full potential of these molecules for rational engineering.},

  Abstract                 = {As part of the Community Structure-Activity Resource ({CSAR)} center, a set of 343 high-quality, protein?ligand crystal structures were assembled with experimentally determined Kd or Ki information from the literature. We encouraged the community to score the crystallographic poses of the complexes by any method of their choice. The goal of the exercise was to (1) evaluate the current ability of the field to predict activity from structure and (2) investigate the properties of the complexes and methods that appear to hinder scoring. A total of 19 different methods were submitted with numerous parameter variations for a total of 64 sets of scores from 16 participating groups. Linear regression and nonparametric tests were used to correlate scores to the experimental values. Correlation to experiment for the various methods ranged R2 = 0.58?0.12, Spearman ? = 0.74?0.37, Kendall τ = 0.55?0.25, and median unsigned error = 1.00?1.68 {pKd} units. All types of scoring functions?force field based, knowledge based, and empirical?had examples with high and low correlation, showing no bias/advantage for any particular approach. The data across all the participants were combined to identify 63 complexes that were poorly scored across the majority of the scoring methods and 123 complexes that were scored well across the majority. The two sets were compared using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test to assess any significant difference in the distributions of {\textgreater}400 physicochemical properties of the ligands and the proteins. Poorly scored complexes were found to have ligands that were the same size as those in well-scored complexes, but hydrogen bonding and torsional strain were significantly different. These comparisons point to a need for {CSAR} to develop data sets of congeneric series with a range of hydrogen-bonding and hydrophobic characteristics and a range of rotatable bonds.},

  Abstract                 = {The ability to interact with cell surface glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) is essential to the cell migration properties of chemokines, but association with soluble GAGs induces the oligomerization of most chemokines including CXCL12. Monomeric CXCL12, but not dimeric CXCL12, is cardioprotective in a number of experimental models of cardiac ischemia. We found that co-administration of heparin, a common treatment for myocardial infarction, abrogated the protective effect of CXCL12 in an ex vivo rat heart model for myocardial infarction. The interaction between CXCL12 and heparin oligosaccharides has previously been analyzed through mutagenesis, in vitro binding assays, and molecular modeling. However, complications from heparin-induced CXCL12 oligomerization and studies using very short oligosaccharides have led to inconsistent conclusions as to the residues involved, the orientation of the binding site, and whether it overlaps with the CXCR4 N-terminal site. We used a constitutively dimeric variant to simplify the NMR analysis of CXCL12-binding heparin oligosaccharides of varying length. Biophysical and mutagenic analyses reveal a CXCL12/heparin interaction surface that lies perpendicular to the dimer interface, does not involve the chemokine N terminus, and partially overlaps with the CXCR4-binding site. We further demonstrate that heparin-mediated enzymatic protection results from the promotion of dimerization rather than direct heparin binding to the CXCL12 N terminus. These results clarify the structural basis for GAG recognition by CXCL12 and lend insight into the development of CXCL12-based therapeutics.},
