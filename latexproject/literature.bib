  abstract = {Treating flexibility in molecular docking is a major challenge in
	cell biology research. Here we describe the background and the principles
	of existing flexible protein-protein docking methods, focusing on
	the algorithms and their rational. We describe how protein flexibility
	is treated in different stages of the docking process: in the preprocessing
	stage, rigid and flexible parts are identified and their possible
	conformations are modeled. This preprocessing provides information
	for the subsequent docking and refinement stages. In the docking
	stage, an ensemble of pre-generated conformations or the identified
	rigid domains may be docked separately. In the refinement stage,
	small-scale movements of the backbone and side-chains are modeled
	and the binding orientation is improved by rigid-body adjustments.
	For clarity of presentation, we divide the different methods into
	categories. This should allow the reader to focus on the most suitable
	method for a particular docking problem.},

	multiple contacts with amino acid residues on the backside of the
	catK molecule that help to facilitate complex formation. As cathepsin
	L does not exhibit a significant collagenase activity in the presence
	or in the absence of C4-S, we substituted the C4-S interacting residues
	in catK with those of cathepsin L. Variants revealed altered collagenolytic
	activities with the largest inhibitory effect shown by the hexavariant
	M5. None of the variants showed a reduction in their gelatinolytic
	and peptidolytic activities when compared with wild-type catK, indicating
	no structural alteration within their active sites. However, the
	crystal structure of the M5 variant in the presence of oligomeric
	C4-S revealed a different binding of chondroitin 4-sulfate. C4-S
	is not continuously ordered as it is in the wild-type catK·C4-S complex.
	The orientation and the direction of the hexasaccharide on the catK
	surface have changed, so that the hexasaccharide is positioned between
	two symmetry-related molecules. Only one M5 variant molecule of the
	dimer that is present in the asymmetric unit interacts with C4-S.
	These substitutions have changed the mode of catK binding to C4-S
	and, as a result, have likely affected the collagenolytic potential
	of the variant. The data presented here support our hypothesis that
	distinct catK/C4-S interactions are necessary for the collagenolytic

	complexes. Our solvated docking protocol is based on the concept
	of the first encounter complex in which a water layer is present
	in-between the molecules. It mimics the pathway from this initial
	complex towards the final assembly in which most waters have been
	expelled from the interface. Docking is performed from solvated biomolecules
	and waters are removed in a biased Monte Carlo procedure based on
	water-mediated contact propensities obtained from an analysis of
	high-resolution crystal structures. {RESULTS:} We demonstrate the
	feasibility of this approach for protein-protein complexes representing
	both "wet" and "dry" interfaces. Solvated docking leads to improvements
	both in quality and scoring. Water molecules are recovered that closely
	match the ones in the crystal structures.},

  abstract = {Proteins are dynamic molecules and often undergo conformational change
	upon ligand binding. It is widely accepted that flexible loop regions
	have a critical functional role in enzymes. Lack of consideration
	of binding site flexibility has led to failures in predicting protein
	functions and in successfully docking ligands with protein receptors.
	Here we address the question: which sequence and structural features
	distinguish the structurally flexible and rigid binding sites? We
	analyze high-resolution crystal structures of ligand bound (holo)
	and free (apo) forms of 41 proteins where no conformational change
	takes place upon ligand binding, 35 examples with moderate conformational
	change, and 22 cases where a large conformational change has been
	observed. We find that the number of residue-residue contacts observed
	per-residue (contact density) does not distinguish flexible and rigid
	binding sites, suggesting a role for specific interactions and amino
	acids in modulating the conformational changes. Examination of hydrogen
	bonding and hydrophobic interactions reveals that cases that do not
	undergo conformational change have high polar interactions constituting
	the binding pockets. Intriguingly, the large, aromatic amino acid
	tryptophan has a high propensity to occur at the binding sites of
	examples where a large conformational change has been noted. Further,
	in large conformational change examples, hydrophobic-hydrophobic,
	aromatic-aromatic, and hydrophobic-polar residue pair interactions
	are dominant. Further analysis of the Ramachandran dihedral angles
	(phi, psi) reveals that the residues adopting disallowed conformations
	are found in both rigid and flexible cases. More importantly, the
	binding site residues adopting disallowed conformations clustered
	narrowly into two specific regions of the L-Ala Ramachandran map.
	Examination of the dihedral angles changes upon ligand binding shows
	that the magnitude of phi, psi changes are in general minimal, although
	some large changes particularly between right-handed alpha-helical
	and extended conformations are seen. Our work further provides an
	account of conformational changes in the dihedral angles space. The
	findings reported here are expected to assist in providing a framework
	for predicting protein-ligand complexes and for template-based prediction

	bond is 1.6 kcal/mol at the {MP2} level and 1.4 kcal/mol at the standard
	level. Its ground state has one of three {HCOS} torsion angles trans
	and one of three {COSO} torsion angles trans. Rotation over 60° around
	the single {O\&bond;S} bond in the sulfate group costs 2.5 kcal/mol
	at the {MP2} and 2.1 kcal/mol at the standard level. For ethyl sulfate,
	the calculated rotational barrier in going from the ground state,
	which has its {CCOS} torsion angle trans, to the syn-periplanar conformation
	({CCOS} torsion angle cis) is 4.8 kcal/mol. However, a much lower
	barrier of 0.7 kcal/mol leads to a secondary gauchelike conformation
	about 0.4 kcal/mol above the ground state, with the {CCOS} torsion
	angle at 87.6°. Again, one of the {COSO} torsion angles is trans
	in the ground state, and the rotational barrier for a 60° rotation
	of the sulfate group amounts to 1.8 kcal/mol. For methyl sulfamate,
	the rotational barriers are 2.5 kcal/mol around the {C\&bond;N} bond
	and 3.3 kcal/mol around the {N\&bond;S} bond. This is noteworthy
	because sulfamate itself has a calculated rotational barrier around
	the {N\&bond;S} bond of only 1.7 kcal/mol. These and other data were
	used to parameterize the well-known empirical force fields {AMBER}
	and {CHARMm.} When the new fields were tested by means of vibrational
	frequency calculations at the 6-{31G*//6-31G*} level for methyl sulfate,
	sulfamate, and methyl sulfamate ground states, the frequencies compared
	favorably with the {AMBER} and {CHARMm} calculated frequencies. The
	transferability of the force parameters to beta-D-glucose-6-sulfate
	and isopropyl sulfate appears to be better than to isopropyl sulfamate.

	exploited for the retrieval and design of new ligands. Structure-based
	ligand design is an iterative approach. First of all, it requires
	the crystal structure or a model derived from the crystal structure
	of a closely related homolog of the target protein, preferentially
	complexed with a ligand. This complex unravels the binding mode and
	conformation of a ligand under investigation and indicates the essential
	aspects determining its binding affinity. It is then used to generate
	new ideas about ways of improving an existing ligand or of developing
	new alternative bonding skeletons. Computational methods supplemented

	generation. The features of the protein binding pocket can be translated

	It is used for both identifying correct poses of a ligand in the
	binding site of a protein as well as for the estimation of the strength
	of protein–ligand interaction. Because millions of compounds must
	be screened, before a suitable target for biological testing can
	be identified, all calculations should be done in a reasonable time
	frame. Thus, all programs currently in use exploit empirically based
	algorithms, avoiding systematic search of the conformational space.
	Similarly, the scoring is done using simple equations, which makes
	it possible to speed up the entire process. Therefore, docking results
	have to be verified by subsequent in vitro studies. The purpose of
	our work was to evaluate seven popular docking programs (Surflex,
	{LigandFit}, Glide, {GOLD}, {FlexX}, {eHiTS}, and {AutoDock)} on
	the extensive dataset composed of 1300 protein–ligands complexes
	from {PDBbind} 2007 database, where experimentally measured binding
	affinity values were also available. We compared independently the
	ability of proper posing [according to Root mean square deviation
	(or Root mean square distance) of predicted conformations versus
	the corresponding native one] and scoring (by calculating the correlation
	between docking score and ligand binding strength). To our knowledge,
	it is the first large-scale docking evaluation that covers both aspects
	of docking programs, that is, predicting ligand conformation and
	calculating the strength of its binding. More than 1000 protein–ligand
	pairs cover a wide range of different protein families and inhibitor
	classes. Our results clearly showed that the ligand binding conformation
	could be identified in most cases by using the existing software,
	yet we still observed the lack of universal scoring function for

	docking and it identifies several directions for future research.
	Recent results from the {CAPRI} blind docking experiments show that
	docking algorithms are steadily improving in both reliability and
	accuracy. Current docking algorithms employ a range of efficient
	search and scoring strategies, including e.g. fast Fourier transform
	correlations, geometric hashing, and Monte Carlo techniques. These
	approaches can often produce a relatively small list of up to a few
	thousand orientations, amongst which a near-native binding mode is
	often observed. However, despite the use of improved scoring functions
	which typically include models of desolvation, hydrophobicity, and
	electrostatics, current algorithms still have difficulty in identifying
	the correct solution from the list of false positives, or decoys.
	Nonetheless, significant progress is being made through better use
	of bioinformatics, biochemical, and biophysical information such
	as e.g. sequence conservation analysis, protein interaction databases,
	alanine scanning, and {NMR} residual dipolar coupling restraints
	to help identify key binding residues. Promising new approaches to
	incorporate models of protein flexibility during docking are being
	developed, including the use of molecular dynamics snapshots, rotameric
	and off-rotamer searches, internal coordinate mechanics, and principal
	component analysis based techniques. Some investigators now use explicit
	solvent models in their docking protocols. Many of these approaches
	can be computationally intensive, although new silicon chip technologies
	such as programmable graphics processor units are beginning to offer
	competitive alternatives to conventional high performance computer
	systems. As cryo-{EM} techniques improve apace, docking {NMR} and
	X-ray protein structures into low resolution {EM} density maps is
	helping to bridge the resolution gap between these complementary
	techniques. The use of symmetry and fragment assembly constraints
	are also helping to make possible docking-based predictions of large
	multimeric protein complexes. In the near future, the closer integration
	of docking algorithms with protein interface prediction software,
	structural databases, and sequence analysis techniques should help
	produce better predictions of protein interaction networks and more
	accurate structural models of the fundamental molecular interactions

	in key processes in the extracellular matrix by interactions with
	protein targets. Due to their charged nature, accurate consideration
	of electrostatic and water-mediated interactions is indispensable
	for understanding {GAGs} binding properties. However, solvent is
	often overlooked in molecular recognition studies. Here we analyze
	the abundance of solvent in {GAG-protein} interfaces and investigate
	the challenges of adding explicit solvent in {GAG-protein} docking
	experiments. We observe {PDB} {GAG-protein} interfaces being significantly
	more hydrated than protein-protein interfaces. Furthermore, by applying
	molecular dynamics approaches we estimate that about half of {GAG-protein}
	interactions are water-mediated. With a dataset of eleven {GAG-protein}
	complexes we analyze how solvent inclusion affects Autodock 3, {eHiTs},
	{MOE} and {FlexX} docking. We develop an approach to de novo place
	explicit solvent into the binding site prior to docking, which uses
	the {GRID} program to predict positions of waters and to locate possible
	areas of solvent displacement upon ligand binding. To investigate
	how solvent placement affects docking performance, we compare these
	results with those obtained by taking into account information about
	the solvent position in the crystal structure. In general, we observe
	that inclusion of solvent improves the results obtained with these

	difficulties to quantitatively reproduce experimental data on specificity
