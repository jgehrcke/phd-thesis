Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are a class of linear polysaccharides, built of
periodically occurring disaccharide units. GAGs are ubiquitous in the
extracellular matrix (ECM), where they exhibit multifarious biological
activities. This diversity arises from --- among others --- their ability to
interact with and regulate a large number of proteins, such as cytokines,
chemokines, and growth factors. As of the huge variety in their chemical
configuration, GAGs are further sub-classified into different types of GAGs
(heparin, for instance, is one of these sub-classes). Hence, GAGs are a
\textit{diverse} class of molecules, which surely contributes to the broadness
of their spectrum of biological functions. Through varying arrangements of
sulfate groups and different types of monosaccharides, individual GAG molecules
can establish highly specific atomic contacts to certain proteins. One of the
best-studied examples is antithrombin-heparin, whose biologically relevant
interaction requires a specific pentasaccharide sequence
\cite{antithrombin-thrombin-heparin-2004}. It is valid to assume, however, that
various proteins whose biological function is in some way affected by GAGs are
yet to be discovered. In other cases, and this is true for the cytokine
interleukin-10 (IL-10), there are already experimental clues for a biologically
relevant protein-GAG interaction, but the details are still obscure and the
fundamental molecular interaction mechanism has still not been clarified.

IL-10 has been shown to bind certain GAGs \cite{salek_ardakani_2000}. So far,
however, no structural detail about IL-10-GAG interaction is known.
Function-wise, IL-10 is mainly considered to be immunosuppressive and
anti-inflammatory, but it in fact has the pleiotropic ability to positively
\textit{and} negatively influence the innate and adaptive immune system, i.e.\
it constitutes quite a complex regulation system on its own. Therefore, the role
of GAGs in this system is potentially substantial, but is yet to be clarified.
From in \textit{in vitro} experiments, there are indications that GAGs may
modulate IL-10's biological function \cite{salek_ardakani_2000}. This and the
fact that IL-10 and GAGs are both present in the ECM give rise to the assumption
that IL-10-GAG interaction is of biological relevance, and that understanding
the impact of GAGs on IL-10 biology is important. A promising approach for
obtaining knowledge about the nature of IL-10-GAG interaction is the
investigation of this system on the structural level, i.e.\ the identification
and characterization of the molecular interaction mechanisms that govern the
IL-10-GAG system on the atomic level.

In this PhD project it was my goal to reveal structural and molecular details
about IL-10-GAG interaction with theoretical and computational means, and with
the help of experiments performed by collaborators. In the course of the
project, three methods were developed for the \textit{in silico} investigation
of protein-GAG complexes and subsequently applied them to the IL-10-GAG system.

I proposed and validated a systematic approach for predicting GAG binding
regions on a given protein, based on the numerical simulation and analysis of
the Coulomb potential of the protein. One major advantage of this method is its
intrinsic ability to assess the reliability of the resulting prediction. In case
of IL-10, the application of this method lead to the observation that its
Coulomb attraction for GAGs is significantly weaker than in case of exemplary
protein-GAG systems (such as FGF2-heparin). Still, a distinct IL-10-GAG binding
region centered on the residues R102, R104, R106, R107 of the human IL-10
monomer was identified, and this region can be assumed to play a major role in
IL-10-GAG interaction, as described in \cref{chapter:bspred}.

Molecular docking methods are often used to generate a binding mode prediction
for a given receptor-ligand system. In \cref{chapter:clustering}, I clarify the
importance of data clustering as an essential step for post-processing an
ensemble of docking solutions. In the course of the PhD project, I developed a
clustering methodology optimized for GAG molecules. It allows for a reproducible
analysis, enabling systematic comparisons among different docking studies. This
clustering approach has become standard procedure in the Pisabarro research
group. It has so far been used in a variety of published studies (e.g.
\cite{franz_cathepsin_2013}), and also played an important role in the
investigation of the IL-10-GAG system, as described in \cref{chapter:dmdil10} of
this thesis.

Motivated by the shortcomings of classical docking approaches, especially with
respect to protein-GAG systems, we (a colleague of mine and I) developed a
molecular dynamics-based docking method with less radical approximations than
usually applied in classical docking. The goal was to make the computational
model properly account for the special physical properties of GAGs, and to
especially include the effects of flexibility and solvation. We named the method
Dynamic Molecular Docking (DMD), and successfully published its concept together
with a validation study \cite{dmd_samsonov_gehrcke_2014}. The following
application of DMD in a variety of studies required enormous amounts of
computational resources. For tackling this challenge, I established a graphics
processing unit-based high performance computing (HPC) environment in our
research group and developed a software framework for reliably performing DMD
studies on this hardware, as well as on other HPC resources of the TU Dresden.

The subsequent investigation of the IL-10-GAG system via DMD was focused on the
IL-10-GAG binding region predicted earlier, and made heavy usage of the
optimized clustering approach. An important result of this endeavor is that
IL-10's amino acid residue R107 significantly stands out compared to all other
residues and supposedly plays a particularly important role in IL-10-GAG
recognition.

Furthermore, the collaboration with the NMR laboratory of Prof. Daniel Huster at
University Leipzig was fruitful: I post-processed nuclear Overhauser effect data
and obtained GAG structure models, which revealed that IL-10-heparin interaction
has a measurable impact on the backbone structure of the heparin molecule. These
results were published in \cite{kuenze_gehrcke_2014}.

\hl{Crystal structure sulfate groups, ternary receptor model, binding region
prediction, lead to models that might explain the role of IL-10-GAG interaction
in IL-10 biology...}.

In conclusion, valuable information for deepening the understanding of the
molecular mechanism governing IL-10-GAG interaction have been derived. These
observations pave the further way towards unraveling GAG-mediated bioactivity of
IL-10, which may then be specifically exploited, for instance in artificial
extracellular matrices for improved wound healing. Furthermore, various methods
have been developed which are generically applicable for the investigation of
protein-GAG systems.
