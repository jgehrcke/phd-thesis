Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are a class of linear polysaccharides, built of
periodically occurring disaccharide units. GAGs are ubiquitous in the
extracellular matrix (ECM), where they exhibit multifarious biological
activities. This diversity arises from --- among others --- their ability to
interact with and regulate a large number of proteins, such as cytokines,
chemokines, and growth factors. As of the huge variety in their chemical
configuration, GAGs are further sub-classified into different types of GAGs
(heparin, for instance, is one of these sub-classes). Hence, GAGs are a
\textit{diverse} class of molecules, which surely contributes to the broadness
of their spectrum of biological functions. Through varying arrangements of
sulfate groups and different types of uronic acid monosaccharides, certain GAG
molecules can establish highly specific atomic contacts to certain proteins. One
of the best-studied examples is antithrombin-heparin, whose biologically
relevant interaction requires a specific pentasaccharide sequence
\cite{antithrombin-thrombin-heparin-2004}. It is valid to assume, however, that
various biologically relevant protein-GAG systems have still not been
discovered. In other cases, the fundamental protein-GAG interaction mechanism
has still not been clarified on the atomic level, as done for the
antithrombin-heparin system.

The cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) has been shown to bind GAGs
\cite{salek_ardakani_2000}. So far, however, no structural detail about
IL-10-GAG interaction is known. Function-wise, IL-10 is mainly considered to be
immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory, but it in fact has the pleiotropic
ability to positively \textit{and} negatively influence the innate and adaptive
immune system, i.e.\ it constitutes quite a complex regulation system on its
own, and the role of GAGs in this system is yet to be clarified. From in
\textit{in vitro} experiments, there are indications that GAGs may modulate
IL-10's biological function \cite{salek_ardakani_2000}. This and the fact that
IL-10 and GAGs are both are present in the ECM give rise to the assumption that
IL-10-GAG interaction is of biological relevance, and that understanding the
impact of GAGs on IL-10 biology is important. A promising approach for obtaining
knowledge about the relevance of IL-10-GAG interaction is the investigation of
this system on the structural level, i.e.\ the identification and
characterization of the molecular interaction mechanisms that govern the
IL-10-GAG system, on the atomic level.

In this PhD project, it was my goal to obtain details of IL-10-GAG interaction
with theoretical and computational means, and with the help of experiments
performed by collaborators. In the course of the project, I developed three
methods for the \textit{in silico} investigation of protein-GAG and subsequently
applied them to the IL-10-GAG system.

First of all, I proposed and validated a systematic approach for predicting a
GAG binding region on a given protein, purely based on the numerical calculation
and analysis of the Coulomb potential of the protein. One major advantage of
this method is its intrinsic ability to assess the reliability of the resulting
prediction. In case of IL-10, the application of this method lead to the
observation that its Coulomb attraction for GAGs is significantly weaker than in
case of exemplary protein-GAG systems such as FGF2-heparin. Still, a putative
IL-10-GAG binding region centered on R102, R104, R106, R107 of the human IL-10
monomer was identified, and this region can be assumed to play a major role in
IL-10-GAG interaction, as described in \cref{chapter:bspred}.

So-called molecular docking methods are often used to generate a binding pose
prediction for a given receptor-ligand system. In \cref{chapter:clustering}, the
importance of data clustering as an essential step for post-processing an
ensemble of docking solutions is clarified. In the course of the PhD project, I
developed a clustering methodology optimized for GAG molecules. It allows for a
reproducible analysis, enabling systematic comparisons among different docking
studies. This clustering approach has become standard procedure in the Pisabarro
research group and has already been used in a variety of studies for a number of
systems, including the IL-10-GAG system.

Their multifarious biological activity arises from their ability to interact
with and regulate a large number of proteins.

  To that end, including Dynamic Molecular Docking
(DMD), a novel molecular dynamics-based protocol for local docking of
protein-GAG systems and a spatial clustering approach optimized for the
interpretation of GAG docking solution ensembles. Evaluation of IL-10's
electrostatic potential led to the prediction of one major putative IL-10-GAG
binding region. Via in-depth analysis of this binding region with DMD and an
exhaustive evaluation of molecular dynamics data, IL-10's residue R107 was
identified to play a particularly important role in IL-10-GAG recognition.
Furthermore, interpretation of NMR spectroscopy data obtained by collaboration
partners led to the observation of GAG-internal structural changes upon binding
to IL-10. All this is valuable information for deepening the understanding of
the molecular mechanism governing IL-10-GAG interaction. If unraveled,
GAG-mediated bioactivity of IL-10 may be specifically exploited in artificial
extracellular matrices for improved wound healing, as is the goal of the DFG
Transregio 67.
