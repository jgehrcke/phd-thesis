- change "fig." to "figure"?


Content-wise:

- in introduction clarify differences between human and murine IL-10, because
later, latest in NMR, this becomes important.

- correct figures w.r.t CS-4 / CS4. I think most of the time I used CS4, so
I should change all CS-4 occurrences.

- abbreviations list?
PDB
MD
NOE
NMR
IL-10
GAG


- explain degree of polymerization (dpX) in words in the introduction, not
(only) in the abbrev list.

- intro: introduce N-terminus, used in chapter 7.1.

- in NMR MD section, write more about why simulated annealing simulations, and give some
references for similar work, and more literature in general about NMR MD restraint methods

- in clustering section: point out somehow that this topic is often neglected
by others (in published docking work)?

- in intro: also introduce force fields, i.e. FF99SB and GLYCAM06.

- in estatic discussion: read

Mayte first correction TODO:
- write summary (up to three pages, according to promotionsordnung)
- better introduce each chapter, with clarifying MY contribution.
- clarify I WE etc
