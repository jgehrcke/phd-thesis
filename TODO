Content-wise:
- abbreviations list?

- in NMR MD section, write more about why simulated annealing simulations, and give some
references for similar work, and more literature in general about NMR MD restraint methods

- in clustering section: point out somehow that this topic is often neglected
by others (in published docking work)?

- in intro: also introduce force fields, i.e. FF99SB and GLYCAM06.

- in estatic discussion: read

Mayte first correction TODO:
- write summary (up to three pages, according to promotionsordnung)
- better introduce each chapter, with clarifying MY contribution.
- clarify I WE etc
