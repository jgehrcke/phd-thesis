- change Nomenclature to Abbreviations?

- remove general abbreviations list from main.tex (distribute to first occurrences)?

- fix year in online url citations. looks weird right now.

Content-wise:

- check chapter page headings

- correct figures w.r.t CS-4 / CS4. I think most of the time I used CS4, so
I should change all CS-4 occurrences.
