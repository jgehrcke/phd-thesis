* Introduction
    - Relevance of IL-10 in immune regulation
    - Vision: gain control over IL-10 in artificial extracellular matrices
    - Bio-relevant IL-10-GAG interaction? Motivated by Salek ardakini.
    - Motivation and goal: investigate IL-10-GAG system with computational
      methods


* IL-10: biology, structure, structure-function, GAG interaction
    - Biology summary
        in closing remarks, relate to extracellular matrix

    - Structure description
        exists mainly as homodimer [
            biochemistry, 1998, 37, 16943-16951, zdanov 1995]

    - IL-10 and its receptors
        - what is known in literature
            R1+IL-10 structure
            R2 structure
            ternary complex binding models
            what is required for signaling? literature overview
        - a critical review: monomer
            minimal unit required for signaling (monomer)
        - IL-10 + R1 + R2 structure model from IL20 ternary complex

    - IL-10-GAG interaction
        - Salek ardakini summary
        - A critical view on consensus sequences
            weintraub sequence and sequences of others
            relate sequence to structure, see that there is no point.
        - arginin patch [zdanov, 1995]
        - the fact that it is a cytokine
        - sulfate groups in the crystal structure


* In-silico: protein-GAG docking methods
    - A docking methods primer
    - methods applied in literature: a mini review
    - Problems of different complexity: local vs. global docking.


* A simple method for predicting protein-GAG binding sites


* Interpreting docking results: docking ensemble clustering\

    - Significance of clustering: mini review
        clustering in general
        clustering in docking: most probable state

    - A meaningful distance metric: RMSatd

    - Clustering methods overview
        hierarchical clustering implemented in AutoDockTools
            badly implemented, due to N^2 dependence very long runtimes
        other methods, quick
        DBSCAN, explain why it makes sense for molecular structures
        cite cpptraj, which also started implementing it

    - Custom implementation of the DBSCAN algorithm
        - architecture and project overview
            command line tool, simple PDB parser files
            distance matrix calculation on multiple cores via Unix fork()
        - examples
            http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html
            http://bit.ly/1pKNv7v
        - RMSatd in numpy
        - DBSCAN in numpy
        - parameter optimization (parameter space transformation)
        - input and output example
            input: structure ensemble, DBSCANopt parameters
            output: structure files, stat summary
